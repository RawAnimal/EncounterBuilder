# Encounter Builder

Welcome to the **Encounter Builder**! This project is designed as a simple, local web-based tool to help Dungeon Masters (DMs) create encounters for **Dungeons & Dragons** using the 2024 ruleset. Whether you're planning epic battles or quick skirmishes, this tool can help you balance encounters and manage adversaries efficiently.

## Features

- Supports encounter building using the 2024 D&D ruleset (2024 monsters).
- Allows you to add, remove, and manage party members and adversaries.
- Includes a name generator. Options can be limited by Male, Female and Species.
- Adversaries can be filtered by name, CR, XP range, Habitat, Type and Group.
- Calculates XP budget (low, moderate or high) and compares it to the encounter's total XP for balanced gameplay.
- XP budget is calculated by Average Party Level by default but can be changed to a total individual calculation.
- Supports saving and loading parties, adversary groups, and entire encounters.
- Encounters can be printed to take with you or saved as PDF.
- Uses a simple and intuitive web interface.
